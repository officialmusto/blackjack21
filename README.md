## Description
*How to Play:*

1. Review your cards and click on any button to start the game.
2. Select your bet amount using the slider. Confirm by clicking on 'confirm'.
3. Click on the "Hit" button to deal the cards. You will be dealt two cards face up, while the dealer will be dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.
4. Click on the "Hit" button to draw additional cards if you want to improve your hand. (You can continue to hit until you are satisfied with your hand or you go over 21, which results in a bust.)
5. Once you are satisfied with your hand, click on the "Stay" button to end your turn and allow the dealer to play their hand. (The dealer will hit until their hand is at least 17 or they bust.)
6. The winner is determined by comparing the values of the player's and dealer's hands. The hand value is calculated by adding up the value of the cards, with face cards being worth 10, and an ace being worth 1 or 11 (whichever is more advantageous).


*If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If neither busts, the higher hand value wins. If there is a tie, the game ends in a draw and the amount betted gets returned.*
