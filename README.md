## How to Play
Click on the "Bet" button to start the game, and select your bet amount using the slider.
Click on the "Deal" button to deal the cards. You will be dealt two cards face up, while the dealer will be dealt two cards, one face up and one face down.
Click on the "Hit" button to draw additional cards if you want to improve your hand. You can continue to hit until you are satisfied with your hand, or you go over 21, which results in a bust.
Once you are satisfied with your hand, click on the "Stay" button to end your turn and allow the dealer to play their hand. The dealer will hit until their hand is at least 17 or they bust.
The winner is determined by comparing the values of the player's and dealer's hands. The hand value is calculated by adding up the value of the cards, with face cards being worth 10 and an ace being worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous. If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If neither busts, the higher hand value wins. If there is a tie, the game ends in a draw.
